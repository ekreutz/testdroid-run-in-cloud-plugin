    <p>If selected we will use App Crawler to all builds. Otherwise you can set your own test instrumentation.</p>

    <p>App Crawler is an intelligent application crawler that exercises each application systematically by traversing
        each application through each of the views in the view hierarchy taking screenshots and recording performance
        data as the crawler progresses through each view.</p>
